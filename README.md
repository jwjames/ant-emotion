## Backstory
In 2019, while working at Cheerity, we leveraged Ant Design components throughout our app. Our goal was to create a highly customizable WYSIWYG panel for clients to personalize their website designs. To achieve this, I extended Ant Design with Emotion, utilizing its powerful CSS prop to alter the default styling included in Ant Design.
